          Despite evidence of a positive relationship between information technology (IT) investments and firm performance,
          results still vary across firms and performance measures. We explore two organizational explanations for this variation:
          differences in firms’ IT investment allocations and their IT capabilities. We develop a theoretical model of IT resources,
          defined as the combination of specific IT assets and organizational IT capabilities. We argue that investments into different
          IT assets are guided by firms’ strategies (e.g., cost leadership or innovation) and deliver value along performance dimensions
          consistent with their strategic purpose. We hypothesize that firms derive additional value per IT dollar through a mutually
          reinforcing system of organizational IT capabilities built on complementary practices and competencies. Empirically, we
          test the impact of IT assets, IT capabilities, and their combination on four dimensions of firm performance: market
          valuation, profitability, cost, and innovation. Our results—based on data on IT investment allocations and IT capabilities
          in 147 U.S. firms from 1999 to 2002—demonstrate that IT investment allocations and organizational IT capabilities drive
          differences in firm performance. Firms’ total IT investment is not associated with performance, but investments in specific
          IT assets explain performance differences along dimensions consistent with their strategic purpose. In addition, a system
          of organizational IT capabilities strengthens the performance effects of IT assets and broadens their impact beyond their
          intended purpose. The results help explain variance in returns to IT capital across firms and expand our understanding of
          alignment between IT and organizations. We illustrate our findings with examples from a case study of 7-Eleven Japan
