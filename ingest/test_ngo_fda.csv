Researchers found that MSM (Men who have Sex with Men) who start having sex early have different identities and behaviours compared with those who start later -- potentially indicating a greater sense of sexual desire, orientation, and identity. Furthermore, they are also subjected to 'name calling' and other 'discriminatory behaviour' in the
society. They also found that younger MSM had low levels of awareness about HIV but had high risk behaviours compared with older MSM. Lack of adequate documentation of same-sex behaviour among adolescents often is a deterrent in designing appropriate targeted interventions for this
population. Thus, there is an urgent need to pursue research and develop targeted interventions for same-sex desiring adolescents in India, with an aim to reduce HIV transmission in this population.","http://humsafar.org/ResDown/RESEARCH%20Building%20evidence%20around%20adolescent%20same-sex%20behavior%20and%20vulnerability%20to%20HIV%20-%202013.pdf","http://hdl.handle.net/2451/33613",,"Mumbai","Humsafar Trust","NYU Libraries is providing access to these materials as a service to our scholarly community.

It also is one of the first explorations of women’s property rights
and HIV in South Asia, where the epidemic is severe but remains fairly concentrated among specific populations. The study is a snapshot of women’s experiences of property and HIV in Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka, where women often are denied their legal rights to property. This snapshot also explores the extent to which organizations are linking women’s property rights and HIV.""","http://www.icrw.org/files/publications/Womens-Property-Rights-as-an-AIDS-Response-Emerging-Efforts-in-South-Asia.pdf","http://hdl.handle.net/2451/33615",,"Washington, DC","Washington, DC : International Center for Research on Women (ICRW)","NYU Libraries is providing access to these materials as a service to our scholarly community.

Using the toolkit, you will be able to plan and organize educational sessions with health care providers to challenge HIV-related stigma and gender-based violence, also referred to as gender violence in this report. The toolkit will help you raise awareness of the causes and consequences of stigma and violence, and promote action and advocacy to combat them.""","http://www.icrw.org/files/publications/Reducing-HIV-Stigma-and-Gender-Based-Violence-Toolkit-for-Health-Care-Providers-in-India.pdf","http://hdl.handle.net/2451/33616",,"Washington, DC","International Center for Research on Women (ICRW)","NYU Libraries is providing access to these materials as a service to our scholarly community.
