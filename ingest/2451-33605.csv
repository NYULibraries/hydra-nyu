Researchers found that MSM (Men who have Sex with Men) who start having sex early have different identities and behaviours compared with those who start later -- potentially indicating a greater sense of sexual desire, orientation, and identity. Furthermore, they are also subjected to 'name calling' and other 'discriminatory behaviour' in the
society. They also found that younger MSM had low levels of awareness about HIV but had high risk behaviours compared with older MSM. Lack of adequate documentation of same-sex behaviour among adolescents often is a deterrent in designing appropriate targeted interventions for this
population.

Ickovics et al. 2002). Since 1997, antiretroviral (ARV) medications have been available in India through the private sector and some employer-supported health insurance programs. It is estimated that India has 5.1 million HIV-infected persons (NACO 2004), some of whom have been on ART for several years. However, very little information is available on the levels of adherence to ART among people living with
HIV/AIDS in India. With increased availability of ART, HIV-positive individuals are living healthier lives and continuing or resuming sexual activity. But, optimism related to ART's success in slowing disease progression, reducing viral load, and improving health status may lead to more risky sexual practices and a possible
increase in transmission of infections. Determining the sexual behavior of HIV-positive persons on ART is therefore an area of special interest and concern. To meet these knowledge gaps, the Horizons Program, in collaboration with research partners in Delhi and Pune, conducted a study to assess current levels of adherence to ART among a sample of people living with HIV/AIDS, identify the factors that influence their adherence to treatment, and determine their sexual risk behaviors. The study also examined the economic burden of ART on the household. Findings from the study provide important insights that are immediately relevant to the scale-up of the national ART program, which was launched in April 2004.""

Framed in terms of an ethics of 'greatest need' connected only to funding availability, all Old IDPs lost out in the resettlement process. This paper attempts to decentre this idea of economic limits and humanitarian need by discussing the manner in which such ideas of 'greatest need' actually emerge from discourses about victimhood that are part of an ethical humanitarian project to which local politics are irrelevant. This paper will show, however that these initiatives consistently intersect with local power hierarchies and local ideas of legitimacy and belonging. Therefore this paper will look at the manner in which the war related victim discourse of International Humanitarianism, helped to exacerbate northern Muslims own marginality and continued exclusion from the north. Looking also at the manner in which victimhood narratives are mobilizsed in Sri Lanka by electoral politics, and displaced IDP activists themselves, this paper will speculate about the efficacy of the victim identity for political and social transformation during this time of transition in Sri Lanka.""

"34723","2451/33605","Ahmed, Trisha||Roy, Avijit",,"South Asia||India||New Delhi","2013-01-16","""The topic of rape has historically been approached from a multitude of angles; it has been justified as an act of uncontrolled emotion of sexual attraction by some, and as a display of supremacy by others. Rape is often regarded as a despicable act that is conducted to display male domination over females, but is power really the only factor in explaining why men rape? Some scientists have pointed out that rape is not geographically unique to any society; it is a cultural universal, meaning that rape occurs in all known cultures. From this perspective, it becomes hard to believe that rape is fueled only by the desire to establish dominance stemming solely from societal influences. If power and social class are the only determining factors, then we would have noticed rich and powerful to be the culprits of the crime. On the contrary, researchers found the overwhelming majority of predatory rapists to be men of lower class and status – men with very dim prospects of gaining ‘legitimate access’ of women. For example, four of the suspects involved in the recent Delhi rape incident lived in a nearby slum, and one of them was the regular driver of the bus. Their wealth and social status were significantly lower than the status of the young psychology student and her male friend. Perhaps, from this line of thinking, many experts are now beginning to believe that power and social status are not the driving forces for rape.""","http://site.voiceofbangladesh.us/voice/287","http://hdl.handle.net/2451/33908",,"Bangladesh","Voice Bangladesh","NYU Libraries is providing access to these materials as a service to our scholarly community.

Significantly, while the concern around demarcating in precise terms the territorial boundaries of the Indian nation-state and who could claim its legal membership endured, the process of executive decisionmaking and the court decisions on citizenship ultimately show how the citizenship question at the commencement of the Republic was fraught with contests. Before one ventures into unraveling these contests, in particular, the manner in which restoration, relocation and alternatively, excision and denial of citizenship took place, it will be pertinent to discuss briefly the legal frameworks of citizenship as they obtained at the birth and early years of the Indian Republic.""","http://www.cwds.ac.in/OCPaper/occasionalpaper54.pdf","http://hdl.handle.net/2451/34234",,"New Delhi","Centre for Women's Development Studies","NYU Libraries is providing access to these materials as a service to our scholarly community.

They were also instrumental in defeating the proposals to implement compulsory education in nine out of eleven municipalities.

Participation in engineering by genders- numerically as well as qualitatively- is taken as an indicator of not just gender equality but as development of the society and the nation as well. Since the definition of infrastructure also has moved on from ‘hard’ objects like dams and bridges and so on to ‘light and soft’ things like computers -software and internet- engineers and engineering also underwent certain image changes. This image change is reflected in women being included as engineers in ‘a profession that has been dubbed as masculine’ (Carter and Kirkup 1990). Nevertheless images apart, are there substantial changes in the relationship between women and engineering? This is a fascinating question to explore considering that so little is studied on women engineers especially in India, situating them within the context of women’s status and their role in the national development. This study is trying to understand the trends and changed relationship in India, using the resources available from the engineering education field mainly in the states of Kerala and Rajasthan.""","http://www.cwds.ac.in/OCPaper/OccasionalPaper58.pdf","http://hdl.handle.net/2451/34238",,"New Delhi","Centre for Women's Development Studies","NYU Libraries is providing access to these materials as a service to our scholarly community.

The paper shows how specific attention to unpaid work in the NSS data can overturn standard assumptions regarding women’s employment, and indeed has relevance for more general discussions on employment growth in India.

In effect, they migrate in a step-by-step phased manner: first within Indian states, mainly to metropolises, then to countries in the Persian Gulf, and further towards the West. It is not a simple, linear course of migration for them nor is it unique in any extraordinary way: yet their stories offer a terrain that is hitherto unexplored. The processes of migration start in the family milieu and involve considerations of job opportunities and information networks, working through precarious work contracts and unreliable middlemen. Meanwhile, their plans often include the life stages of marriage and motherhood. But anyhow, becoming a nurse in India today is in effect preparing to leave one’s homeland, if not forever, at least for long periods of time. The question of constant mobility and negotiation of boundaries within family and the outside world are, therefore, at the heart of the matter.""","http://www.cwds.ac.in/OCPaper/Transcending-sreelekha-ocpaper.pdf","http://hdl.handle.net/2451/34244",,"New Delhi","Centre for Women's Development Studies","NYU Libraries is providing access to these materials as a service to our scholarly community.

This research work empirically examines and explores the process of women's resistance to the male dominion within the sphere of family and law. It is a part of the larger study being taken up by the Centre for Women Development Studies, New Delhi. This part of the study ventures specifically into narratives of women victims of violence involved in the process of litigation within the context of the law relating to domestic violence i.e. Section 498-A, IPC. It does not attempt to examine the judgments pronounced on the issue or try to read in between the lines of court records, rather it looks at the functioning of the Mahila Courts operational in Delhi from the perspective of women litigants in relation to the above law. The study examines the process of operation of law within the larger context and its implication on women. While exploring the individuals' endeavour for justice, it attempts to draw linkages between micro-level struggles with laws and policies at the macro-level, which affects daily lives of victims of violence. The study suggests that the justice delivery system does provide a platform for a woman to raise her concerns and a space to negotiate for her rights, yet, at the same time, it also acts to disqualify her claims and often ends up in re-victimizing the victim.""","http://www.cwds.ac.in/OCPaper/UnderstandingJustice.pdf","http://hdl.handle.net/2451/34251",,"New Delhi","Centre for Women's Development Studies","NYU Libraries is providing access to these materials as a service to our scholarly community.

Accordingly, this paper examines the health sector with a view to highlighting myopic policies and faulty implementation strategies.

The first of these is the Report of the Sub-Committee on 'Woman's Role in Planned Economy' (1947); the second is the Report of the Committee on the Status of Women in India (Government of India, 1974), and the third is the National Perspective Plan for Women, A Perspective Plan the Women's Movement (1988).""","http://www.cwds.ac.in/OCPaper/DevelopmentPatriarchyandPolitics.pdf","http://hdl.handle.net/2451/34260",,"New Delhi","Centre for Women's Development Studies","NYU Libraries is providing access to these materials as a service to our scholarly community.

An attempt is made to demystify the runaway spread of the practice by comparing it with the emergence of female infanticide, also within the last two decades, in a region and a community with no previous history of such a practice. The two stories are presented as manifestations of the same process - though some of the actors are widely different - in terms of class. culture, ethnic traditions, gender role history, population, geography and exposure to debates on reproductive rights, freedom and the autonomy of choice. In the last section, some questions are raised on these philosophical concepts and their social implications.""","http://www.cwds.ac.in/OCPaper/AmniocentesisVM.pdf","http://hdl.handle.net/2451/34261",,"New Delhi","Centre for Women's Development Studies","NYU Libraries is providing access to these materials as a service to our scholarly community.

I will then present a case study of one of the first Bengali women to write her autobiography; if Kailashbashini’s life appears incongruous at the end of a litany of injustices it is only to prove that difference as a value can-and did-put down early roots in a hostile environment. Acknowledging her subordinate position in a male dominated society. Kailashbashini used the skills of literacy effectively. The wife of a Bengali official with reformist tendencies was taught to read and write by her husband. In time, she described in great detail her life; her powerfully reasoned arguments only proved that those regarded as unequal and subordinate could in fact match many in their logic and rationality. Here, the informal, self-taught skills of literacy equipped Kailashbashini to express herself, her pain and her hopes through a long life. The therapeutic value of such an exercise can not be underestimated in a highly segregated, hierarchical society. However, before going further into the role of literacy in facilitating individual self-expression, it is necessary to explore further the relationship between difference and inequality.

Section 3 discusses the consequences of these processes of commodification for women themselves and for their relationships with dominant members of their families. It suggests that it is in the particular context of marriage that women’s entry into paid work has had the greatest repercussions but these ramifications have spilt over into family relationships more generally. Sections 4 and 5 track some of the ways in which these ramifications have played out in the global economy, generating new forces of supply and demand in the labour market as well as further changes in the meanings and experiences of marriage, motherhood and masculinity for different groups of men and women.
