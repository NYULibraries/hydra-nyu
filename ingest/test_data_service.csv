The LandScan algorithm uses spatial data and imagery analysis technologies and a multi-variable dasymetric modeling approach to disaggregate census counts within an administrative boundary. Since no single population distribution model can account for the differences in spatial data availability, quality, scale, and accuracy as well as the differences in cultural settlement practices, LandScan population distribution models are tailored to match the data conditions and geographical nature of each individual country and region ... The LandScan dataset, first produced in 1998, is updated annually by incorporating new spatial data and imagery analysis into the distribution algorithms.--LandScan Documentation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory website, viewed Oct. 13, 2014.",,"873820804","http://hdl.handle.net/2451/33839",,"Oak Ridge National Laboratory","NYU only.","Population -- Statistics -- Databases.||World maps, Physical -- Databases.||Population -- Maps -- Databases.","East View Geospatial LandScan global archive","Dataset","Dataset"
